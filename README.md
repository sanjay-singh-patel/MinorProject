# Indoor Navigation

Navigation apps like Google map are available for navigation but none of them support navigation inside a building by taking into account rooms, corridors and floors. 
It consumes a lot of time to navigate through any building to a particular location inside that building.
The challenge is to create an app that would show a navigation path in the real world on your mobile device screen. This technology is beneficial to everyday citizens because it allows one to accurately navigate to a specific location in a building they have never been to before, such as government offices, a classroom in a campus, malls/retail store to show customers the items they would want to purchase etc.

## CHALLENGES

Apps like Google Maps use satellite imaging and user location data to create maps and points but this is not possible in indoor structures with a good viewing technology.
For ease of use we want to create a web application that does not require any significant customer involvement for use.
Using GPS from a web browser is a challenge in itself, and so we wanted to create a way to make an app free from gps but still reliable.

## Solution

The Indoor Navigation System is a web-based application which is able to navigate the users to their destination or preferred location within a building via the shortest possible way.
Basically there is a view for the client in which they would be able to  
Also, there is one view for the convenience of the user. In this the user can scan the QR code on any of the doors on the building and this would tell them their current location inside the building without using location services of their device. Then they will be prompted to select their destination location. After selecting their destination the user will be provided with a map to the to their destination.
